# Baby Welcome Website

A delightful and interactive website to celebrate the arrival of a baby girl. I personally developed this for a friend who was having a girl but you can always adjust it for a baby boy. This project features a charming design with floating balloons, inspirational quotes, and a fun way to discover baby name ideas.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content**: Displays random inspirational quotes, jokes and fun facts about babies and parenthood.
- **Changing Images**: Shows different baby-related images that update with each new quote.
- **Interactive Balloons**: Colorful balloons float across the screen, each revealing a potential baby name when clicked.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
